# Group 1018 - {Air Quality Analysis}
- Your title can change over time.

## Milestones

Details for Milestone are available on Canvas (left sidebar, Course Project) or [here](https://firas.moosvi.com/courses/data301/project/milestone01.html).

## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words
The topic of our choice is about air quality and its changes throughout the day and year. We are trying to learn about the different levels of pollution throughout the day and its possible effects on the environment. We picked this topic because we found it relevant to important environmental issues like global warming and the Australian wildfires. Analyzing our dataset of choice could show us how different levels of gas changes across the year and across the day, with a little background research, this could help us relate gas emission to events and daily activities such as seasonal celebrations and rush hour.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words
The dataset provided by UCI Machine Learning Repository helps provide data taken from reponses of a gas multisensor device deployed in a city in Italy. It collected concentrations of CO (Carbon Monoxide), Nitrogen Oxides (NO2, NOx), and Benzenes. Data of these highly carcinogenic substances were collected over a period of one year, from March of 2004 to February 2005. This dataset will allow us to learn more about how toxicity levels can shift over time, while also providing insight into how different activities in the day influence the air quality, such are rush hours or livestock farming. This data was collected using an array of 5 metal oxide detectors in a gas multisensor device; it was placed in a largely polluted area at a road level in a city in Italy.
