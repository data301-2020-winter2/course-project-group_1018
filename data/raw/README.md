# Air Quality Dataset

## about the dataset

we picked this dataset to see the daily average levels of toxic gas in an attempt to measure air quality. We also plan to see
the changes of air quality across the year per month.

__NOTE:__: _There are missing values in this dataset, so whatever is measured at -200 is missing_
