## Analysis ##
--------------

- The analysis conducted has helped us find new questions that help us to analyze the questions we have wanted to answer in this project
- From the EDA conducted, it can be seen that there are many gases that contribute to the high levels of gas concentrations
- Gases like CO and NO2 are the result of pollutant particles due to vehicle emissions
- this can be seen by comparing the data of CO and NO2 levels, as their correlation shown by the heatmaps are very high 
- This helps us analyze the gases that might contribute to the high levels of bad air quality during rush hour, as more vehicles leads to a large concentration of pollutants during those hours of high traffic
