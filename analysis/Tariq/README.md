1. We picked Carbon monoxide, benzene, Tungsten oxide and Tin Oxide to measure pollution.
1. I personally chose to try and find a correlation between the GT measurements.
1. I found that although the density goes up and down at different rates it happens within a similar interval across all.
1. My foundings could mean that these gases share sources of production.
